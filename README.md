# hello-world
Just acclimating myself to GitHub environment

I'm a software engineer with almost ten years Java development experience working on a program used by air traffic control specialists and FAA employees to design and evaluate flight patterns around airports. We use Eclipse, git, Maven, and a bit of many other languages and protocols to maintain our code environment. Personally, I love horror movies, video games, cats, cheese, chocolate, short walks in the forest, profanity, sarcasm, and working in my pajamas. I'm a wee bit psychologically wonky, but I suppose that goes without saying in the programming world.
